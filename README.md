# Purpose

This repo is a collection of some of the work that was completed as part of COMP20 at Tufts University.

# Favorites 

My overall favorite assignment was the final project, located at [wikilinks.herokuapp.com](https://wikilinks.herokuapp.com). That being said, of the projects in this repo my favorite was the MBTA project because it allowed me to explore and use the Google Maps API, which I could then compare to the same API for Android development.
