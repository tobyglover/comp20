# Purpose

This repo is a collection of some of the work that was completed as part of COMP20 at Tufts University.

# Picking Favorites 

My overall favorite assignment was the final project, located at [wikilinks.herokuapp.com](https://wikilinks.herokuapp.com). That being said, of the projects in this repo my favorite was the MBTA project because it allowed me to explore and use the Google Maps API, which I could then compare to the Maps API for Android development. 

# Personal Growth

Over the past semester I have definitely grown in my ability to read through spec sheets for a given API and figure out for myself how to do something. This is a skill I had before, but was able to develop more thoroughly during this class.  

# Knowledge Gained

I have come to understand the use of callback functions that define behavior when an action occurs and allow multiple operations to run concurrently. For example: 

1. When a user clicks a button that spawns an event, attaching that event to a callback function so that behavior related to the clicking can be triggered.

2. When using XMLHttpRequest (or JQuery's networking methods) and you supply a callback function so the request can run concurrently and not block the main thread.

# Continuing from here

I have already ported my website ([tobyglover.com](https://tobyglover.com)) into a node app that utilizes templating and server-side operations, giving me a good base to create new web projects off of.
