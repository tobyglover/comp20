	<h1>Security Assessment of Ari Brown's Assignment 3</h1>

	<h2>Introduction</h2>
	<p>The purpose of this page is to outline the security risk's of Ari Brown's project, located at <a href="https://mod2048.herokuapp.com">https://mod2048.herokuapp.com</a>. The project is a simple web service that stores the scores for players after they complete a round of 2048.</p>

	<h2>Methodology</h2>
	<p>As a developer of a very similar project, I knew the basic technology behind the web service and common potential security holes. With this knowledge, I first experimented with the three endpoints to see what I could do, and then looked at the code to verify my findings and find new holes. No additional tools were used, although python was used later to have some fun (see Data Insertion Issue)</p>

	<h2>Abstract of Findings</h2>
	<p>After investigation, I found that a user can store as much data as they want in the service, essentially turning the service into a free database. I also found that this web service is entirely accesible by any other webpage. Finally, a hacker can get a full data dump of all data on the server.</p>

	<h2>Issues found</h2>

	<h3>Data Insertion</h3>
	<p>/submit.json inserts the entire request body into the database, including any extra keys/values. Utilizing this fact, I was able to write a python script that can insert entire directories containing documents, images, and videos into the database and then download them again later into a new directory, essentially turning the web service into a personal datastore. injection.py runs on python2.7, and can be found in its entirety <a href="injection.py">here</a>.</p> 

	<p>To get a payload that I stored in the server earlier you can run: </p> 
	<pre>python injection.py download -k Totally_not_malicious -d &lt;destination_directory&gt;</pre> 

	<p> To store your own data in the server, run: </p>
	<pre>python injection.py inject -k &lt;new_key&gt; -d &lt;source_directory&gt;</pre> 

	<p>This is, of course, taking it to the extreme, but using the server as your own personal key-value store is not a rediculous thought. This is not severe, assuming that users do not insert so much data that the server run into storage limits with the database provider. Therefore, I give this a severity of <strong>medium</strong>. An easy fix is to explicitly insert the values that you want from the request body into the database, rather than inserting the entire request body. Limiting the values to a certain size will help as well, for example usernames probably don't need to be more than 20 characters long.</p>

	<h3>CORS Everywhere</h3>
	<p>Due to the fact that this is essentially an API, granting CORS for certain endpoints is a requirement. However, granting it on all endpoints when it is only needed on /submit.json and /scores.json seems unnecessary. To make matters worse, it has been permitted for all websites rather than for specific "whitelisted" websites. Finally, it allows for CORS not only in GET and POST requests but also on PUT and DELETE requests, which you almost definitely do not want. Due to its openess for malicious attacks from other websites, this is also given a severity of <strong>medium</strong>. The issue is easily resolved through use of a whitelist and only enabling CORS for specific endpoints.</p>

	<h3>Full Data Dump</h3>
	<p>With the web service using MongoDb, standard SQLi attacks are not possible. However, we can still use modifiers in the query string to get a full dump of all data. In /scores.json, if we make our username query "username[$gt]=" it will dump the game data for all users of the service, regardless of username. <a href="http://blog.websecurify.com/2014/08/hacking-nodejs-and-mongodb.html">The websecurify blog</a> has a really good write up on why this works. In short, this is less at fault with the developer and more the fault of how express and body-parser work to make objects out of query strings. A fix is to change the settings of body-parser to work around this issue. Another solution is to make the keys in the database different to the parameters in the url, so MongoDb will be unable to resolve the reference.</p>

	<p>That being said, because the web service does not have any sort of verification before displaying the user data anyway, this exploit is essentially the same as collecting every username from the index page, and then hitting /scores.json with their specific username to get their data. All the exploit does is make this process a bit easier. If the expoloit existed in a seb service that had password verification it would be a severe problem, but in this situation it is <strong>low</strong> severity.</p>

	<h2>Conclusion</h2>

	<p>In conclusion, this is overall a relatively insecure API. No value or size checking is done on incoming requests, allowing for anything to be stored in the database. In addition, CORS allows for any site to take advantage of your site. Finally, zero work is done to prevent a full datadump.</p>
